Developing apps using containerization is like packing your application into a suitcase, along with everything it needs to run properly. This suitcase, or “container”, works the same way no matter where you open it.

This makes running an application as easy as opening a suitcase. For example, if you have a newer version of NGINX for another app, the older version inside the container won’t be affected.

As a developer, this means you’re not relying on the user to set up their computer perfectly for your app to work. You’re essentially giving them the perfect setup along with your app.

Containerization also lets you run multiple apps on the same computer, even if they would have clashed otherwise. Containers are more lightweight than virtual machines because they share the computer’s operating system, rather than needing one for each container. This means you can run more containers with less strain on your computer. Plus, if an app needs a different version of Linux than another on the same computer, it’s not a problem. Containerization really makes software delivery flexible and efficient.
