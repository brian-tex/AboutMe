In my role as an IT Professional in private Higher Education, I've developed a broad range of experience. As part of a small Systems Administration team, I've managed the IT infrastructure from endpoint computing to around 140 Linux and Windows servers.

When I first joined the Systems Administration team, we inherited a well-functioning infrastructure built on open source solutions. To ensure its continued reliability, I immersed myself in understanding how each component worked.

However, we soon realized that our team was shrinking while the number of services we were responsible for remained the same. It was like trying to manage twenty different Sistine Chapels with a skeleton crew. We simply didn't have the capacity to do it effectively.

To address this, we developed a plan to simplify and consolidate our systems. We shut down servers that were no longer needed and consolidated services onto a single server whenever possible. We also reduced the variety of servers we managed, so that most of them were running on a single version of Windows Server and our entire Linux fleet was on Red Hat instead of three different Linux distributions.

These changes made a significant difference. Our workload decreased, and we became more efficient at managing our systems. Our systems remained up and running, which meant we could provide better service to our users.
