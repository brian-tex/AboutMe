Docker Compose is a tool that lets you define and run multi-container Docker applications. It's like a blueprint for your application, where you can specify all the services that make up your app, as well as their configuration. Once you have a docker-compose.yml file, you can use it to start, stop, and restart your application with a single command. You can also share your docker-compose.yml file with others, so they can easily set up your application on their own machines.
