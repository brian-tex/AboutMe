# Cloning a Repo in Git
To work on or use a Git repository (repo) locally, you must "clone" the repo to your computer. Cloning a repo mostly does what it sounds like, it puts an exact replica on your computer. Once there, you can edit it and push it back up to GitHub or GitLab.

### How to Clone a Repo
- Run the following code in Terminal: `git clone git@<hostingServiceAddress>:<organizationOrProjectName>/<repositoryName>.git`
- **Example:** ```git clone git@gitlab.biola.edu:ansible-playbooks/ezproxy.git```
