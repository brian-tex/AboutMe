# Pushing a Change in Git
Making a push in Git is only done on a local repo on your computer and ensures changes other editors have made aren't overwritten. When you make a push, Git takes the original state of your repo and compares it to what is online, if it matches, Git will push all changes you've made to GitHub or GitLab. If your original state doesn't match the current repo online, it'll let you know you need to merge the changes other editors have made to your local version before pushing.

Note: Pushing commits is only needed for files edited locally.

### How to Commit a Change Locally
- Push your changes to GitHub or GitLab by running the following: `git push`
