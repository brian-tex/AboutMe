Tough issues requiring specific understanding and knowledge benefit from human interaction. Meanwhile, automating routine tasks produces consistent outcomes and frees up employees for other work. 

Ansible, Shell Scripts, Cron Jobs, PowerShell, and Task Scheduler are helpful tools. They automate one-time repetitive tasks or manage configuration of a server infrastructure.

The following list links to documentation I've made for various automation tools as well as a few examples of how I've used them in my career.
