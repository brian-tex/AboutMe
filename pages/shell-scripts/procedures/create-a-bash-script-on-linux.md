### How to Create a Bash Script on Linux
1. Create a bash script file on your server with the shell script file extension (i.e., "yourScript.sh").
2. Open the file in a text editor.
3. Define what interpreter should be used when executing the script by addin a shebang to the top of the file (e.g., "#!/bin/bash").
4. Add each command line command into the script. Put each command on a new line with a hashed comment above it describing what the command will do.
5. Save the file.
