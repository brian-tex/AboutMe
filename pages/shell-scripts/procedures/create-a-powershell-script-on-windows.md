### How to Create a PowerShell Script on Windows
1. Create a PowerShell script file on your server with the PowerShell script file extension (i.e., "yourScript.ps1").
2. Open the file in a text editor.
3. Add each command line command into the script. Put each command on a new line with a hashed comment above it describing what the command will do.
4. Save the file.
