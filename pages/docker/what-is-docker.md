**Docker** is a key player in the containerization world, compatible with various platforms like Windows, Mac, and Linux. It’s a tool that developers can use to manage their applications through Docker Desktop and Docker Engine (CLI). Docker enables developers to bundle their applications into Docker images, which can be stored in Docker’s hosted repositories or third-party repositories, ready for deployment across different environments.

Docker also offers Docker Compose, a tool that simplifies the management of multiple applications that need to be deployed together. This feature allows developers and end-users to manage the lifecycle of their container deployments using a configuration-as-code approach, making the process more efficient and straightforward. With Docker, software deployment becomes less of a chore and more of a streamlined process.
