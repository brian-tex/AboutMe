After using Docker for years as a Systems Administrator I've developed some best practices that ensure changes are tracked and revertable.

Though I could (and may in the future) record some of my own training and tutorial content I've found it a better use of my time to curate some of the best content currently out there. When appropriate, I'll embed YouTube links on specific Git tutorials I've found helpful and communicate best practices.
