If configuring a server was like building a sandcastle:
- Manual Configuration Mgmt. & Deployment is like trying to recreate a sandcastle (with every nuance) from a 2D blueprint.
- Ansible Configuration Mgmt. and Deployment is like having a 3D mold of a sandcastle that can be used to instantly build it (with all its nuance).

### Why use Ansible over manual configuration?
- Centralized server configuration management.
- Minimizes the risk of human error.
- Preserves configuration change history.
- Produces consistent and reliable results.
- Frees up employees for other non-repetative tasks.

### Why use Ansible over other solutions?
- It’s based on a human-readable programming language called YAML.
- It uses a push deployment method via SSH. Meaning, there are no endpoint applications to install or manage.
- It’s platform agnostic.
