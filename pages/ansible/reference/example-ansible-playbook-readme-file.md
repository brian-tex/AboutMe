# <Playbook_Name>
Describe the server this playbook will configure, who it is for and the purpose it serves. This will help you keep track of the server as a part of your overall service catalog.

### Playbook Overview
1. <Name_of_First_Role>
2. <Name_of_Second_Role>
3. <Name_of_Third_Role>
```
**Note:**
- You'll need to add the name of each role in the `Playbook Overview` section the playbook will run. This information is in the playbook's `default.yml` file.
