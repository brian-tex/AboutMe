# What are Playbooks?
Ansible playbooks allow us to manage the configuration for and automate the execution of various IT tasks.

In the following video you'll see what it looks like to make a fairly basic playbook. This example will show creating specific tasks in the playbook itself, which is different than how we'll be doing it but will give you an overall idea of what is happening. In our playbooks we granulate out the specific tasks into what Ansible calls **Roles**.

These **Roles** are modularized so that they can be created and managed in one place and be used in countless playbooks. We'll go over roles later in this training.
