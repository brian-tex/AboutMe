After using Ansible for years as a Systems Administrator I've developed some best practices that use my code more efficiently and more easily manage systems at scale.

Though I could (and may in the future) record some of my own training and tutorial content I've found it a better use of my time to curate some of the best content currently out there. When appropriate, I'll embed YouTube links on specific Ansible tutorials I've found helpful and communicate best practices.
