"Ansible is an open source community project sponsored by Red Hat, it's the simplest way to automate IT. Ansible is the only automation language that can be used across entire IT teams from systems and network administrators to developers and managers."[^1]..."Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs."

### Why use Ansible over manual configuration?
- It offers centralized server configuration management.
- It minimizes the risk of human error.
- It preserves configuration change history.
- If configuring a server was like building a sandcastle:
  - **Manual Configuration Mgmt. & Deployment:** It’s like trying to recreate a sandcastle (with every nuance) from a 2D blueprint.
  - **Ansible Configuration Mgmt. and Deployment:** It’s like having a 3D mold of a sandcastle that can be used to instantly build it (with all its nuance).

### Why use Ansible over other solutions?
- It’s based on a human-readable programming language called YAML.
- It uses a push deployment method via SSH. Meaning, there are no applications to install on endpoint computers.
- It’s platform agnostic.
- It’s becoming the industry standard for managing and configuring servers and the services that run on them.
